			<p>On March 27, 1962, the State of New York seized 98.5 acres (40 city blocks) in the heart of downtown Albany. The State&rsquo;s South Mall redevelopment project would displace roughly 7,000 people, hundreds of small businesses, 3 schools, and 4 churches—all to make way for construction of a massive modernist office and cultural complex.</p>

		<h2>The Immediate Response</h2>
	</div>

	<section id="chapter1">	

		<div class="narrative">	

			<p>Local newspaper editors immediately sent reporters out to collect man-on-the-street interviews from the South Mall area. The Albany Democratic Party organized a house-to-house canvass for the same purpose.</p>

			<p>The goals and methods of reporters and political operatives differed dramatically. Owned by the same publisher, Albany&rsquo;s two local newspapers backed the State&rsquo;s South Mall plan with pro-development editorials and stories.  Reporters targeted an area characterized by small businesses and transient residents, where they found support for, or at least acceptance of, the State plan. By contrast, the Democratic canvassers catalogued opposition to the South Mall among an aging population of owner-occupiers and long-term tenants living near the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. Many of these residents were active in the Catholic Church and loyal to the party&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

			<p>Both sets of interviews are skewed, but together, they provide a broader picture of how residents and business owners responded to news of their imminent dispossession. Some greeted the news with optimism, others with anxiety. Overall, a sense of inevitability prevailed.</p>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>The South Mall was unlike most other urban renewal project in the United States. It was a state-initiated plan imposed on a reluctant city with minimal input from local leaders. Albany Mayor Erastus Corning promptly denounced the South Mall plan and brought suit to prevent its implementation. Having just won a sixth term as mayor, he had a 20-year history of fighting off Republican governors&rsquo; attempts to intervene in the capital city&rsquo;s affairs.</p>

			<div>

			</div>

			<p>At his March 30, 1962 press conference, Mayor Corning condemned the South Mall as a &ldquo;cruel hoax.&rdquo; Asked his opinion of the State land seizure, he responded,  &ldquo;Well I think it&rsquo;s a tragedy to the people living in the area. There are very, very good buildings, many people owned their own homes for many years, the relocation problem is staggering&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Corning told the reporters he had received hundreds of letters applauding his opposition to the State plan. Business- and homeowners, Elinor and Leo Mullen, praised the mayor&rsquo;s efforts to prevent seizure of their property and destruction of the tight-knit community in which they lived. She wrote, &ldquo;We hope and pray that God will give you the strength to fight against this communistic method for improving the city of Albany&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Patricia Beaupre called on the mayor to protect her family and neighbors. &ldquo;What good are these monuments,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;The people won&rsquo;t be around to see them, if the houses keep being torn down&hellip;. [T]here won&rsquo;t be anyplace for the people to live. Even tearing down new high schools. Please don&rsquo;t let Governor Rockefeller do these cruel things to us.&rdquo;</p>

			</div>

			<p>Nelson A. Rockefeller, scion of one of America&rsquo;s wealthiest families, aspired to be the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;buildingest governor.&rdquo; The South Mall was his brainchild. Before taking office, Rocky had played a key role in the design and construction of Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art, and the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. As governor, he was responsible for a dramatic expansion of the state&rsquo;s highway and university systems.</p>

			</div>

			<p>To the Governor and his supporters, Albany appeared blighted and in need of revitalization. For this, they blamed the city&rsquo;s Democratic leadership. The chairman of the Citizens United Reform Effort (CURE), a local opposition party, described the mayor&rsquo;s stand on the South Mall as &ldquo;starkly political.&rdquo; He accused the Democratic machine of thriving &ldquo;on decay and deterioration and the miseries of the people.&rdquo; Rule by favors and threats had its greatest impact on the city&rsquo;s poorest residents, and as NAACP official and South Mall resident Harry Vodery pointed out, African Americans bore the brunt of both threats and decay. [pop up sidebar on the $5 vote and threats listed in Harry Vodery speech]</p>

			<p>South Mall boosters argued that reconstruction would beautify Albany and bolster the city&rsquo;s flagging fortunes. The majority of South Mall residents appeared to agree, based on a CURE poll from the summer of 1962. Over the course of a week, 30 volunteers knocked on doors throughout the redevelopment area, asking two questions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Is the South Mall redevelopment project good for Albany</li>
				<li>Is it good for you and your family?</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Of 1,386 adults polled, 956 (or 70%) answered yes to the first question. More than half (717) answered yes to the second.</p>

			<p>And yet poll results tell only part of the story, as Hal Juhre explained in an open letter to Mayor Corning and Gov. Rockefeller: &ldquo;&hellip;.Many of the affected residents—60 of whom I interviewed during the recent CURE survey—are confused and concerned as to how the project will affect people. Will it enhance human welfare and dignity or lead to human misery? The most recurrent theme was &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all in favor of progress, so long as no one gets hurt.&rsquo;&hellip;.&rdquo; Rather than wholesale clearance, Juhre proposed rehabilitation with an emphasis on housing. He pointed out that while the area had deteriorated under Democratic leadership, many of the structures were still sound.</p>

			<p>Within the area slated for demolition, South Mall supporters found run-down rentals, broken sidewalks, and vacant storefronts. Its critics pointed to churches, schools, family homes, and profitable businesses in other sections. Where and why they looked determined what they saw. The 98-acre redevelopment area encompassed several distinct neighborhoods.</p>

				</div>
				<div id="thing3" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">State Street Office District. Adjacent to the New York State Capitol and Alfred E. Smith State Office Building, this was a prime location for lawyers&rsquo; and lobbyists&rsquo; offices, as well as for taverns where lawyers and lobbyists could rub shoulders with legislators. Elegant homes and apartment buildings lined State and Chestnut streets.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="thing4" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">Rooming House District. This neighborhood was home to a large population of elderly single men and women. Conveniently near the Capitol, it also housed unmarried state workers and out-of-town legislators. Rooming houses were both business and home to the divorced or widowed women who owned most of them. Hudson Avenue shops and eateries catered to the residents of this district.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="thing5" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">Hudson Avenue Shopping District. The small businesses in this shopping district were geared toward the needs of rooming house residents—a combination of groceries, restaurants and bars, laundries, tailors, barbershops, and shoe repair stores. Business owners, employees, and other tenants lived in apartments above the storefronts.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="thing6" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">Cathedral Area Neighborhood. For many in this largely residential district, life centered around the Catholic Church and its schools. The population was predominantly white, but as a result of the Great Migration, a growing number of Southern blacks had moved in over the past decades. A smattering of small, mom-and-pop businesses served local residents. This was the neighborhood canvassed by Democratic Party operatives soon after the State announced the South Mall plan.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="thing7" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">Market District. The massive Lyon Block, a former print factory, dominated this area, which encompassed the city farmers market and specialized in produce sales and distribution. Residents lived in rental units above stores and on the edges of this district. This is where the local Boys Club and Methodist Inner City Mission got their start.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="thing8" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">South Pearl Street Shopping District. Best known for bargain clothing, shoes, and furniture, this section drew shoppers from across the region. It also included upscale outlets like B. J. Koblenz Jewelry and M. Solomon Furs and Fashion.</p>

				<div id="thing9" class="narrower">
					<p class="gallery-text">The Gut. Factories stood side-by-side with single-room-occupancy hotels, missions, and taverns in this section of the city. At the turn of the twentieth-century, it had been home to newly-arrived European immigrants. Decades later, Southern migrants settled here before moving up the hill to more prosperous neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>The City&rsquo;s effort to prevent the South Mall failed. On June 29, 1962, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled in the favor of the State. Twelve days later, the first South Mall area building was demolished at a press event featuring Gov. Rockefeller behind the controls of a 60-ton crane. He ceremonially removed a bucket of bricks and then handed them out as souvenirs to the crowd of onlookers.</p>

			</div>

			<p>The following evening, Francisca Abarca, her two children, and tenants became the first of almost 7,000 people displaced for the South Mall. Their house was nextdoor to the demolished structure and relied on it for support, as was true of most of the area&rsquo;s many rowhouses. The destruction of one building endangered adjacent structures&mdash;an apt metaphor for the damage caused by displacement. Forcing area residents out of their homes and neighborhoods created social and emotional as well as economic hardship. [Link to Mindy Fullilove essay.]</p>

Lazarus was in his 70s when he lost his home and business to the South Mall. This loss destroyed his physical and mental health.</p>

In addition to beer and simple food, the bar provided its patrons a home away from their drab rooms and apartments, fostering a sense of community. Owners Morris and Rose Levine worked behind the bar and socialized with their patrons. They organized tabletop shuffleboard competitions and sponsored a bowling league made up of regulars. The bar moved to a new location as a result of the South Mall, but the Dinty&rsquo;s community did not long survive displacement.</p>

As they remember it, their father Ed was always working a second or third job; their mom Dete was always pregnant and taking care of the kids. The children shared beds and a bathroom on the second floor so that the third and fourth could be rented out. Although the Nicholas children mourned their home&rsquo;s loss to the South Mall, Ed regarded its appropriation as a stroke of good luck. The State reimbursement check enabled the family to buy a bigger house in a more prosperous section of the city.</p>

		<h2>Designing the South Mall</h2>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>Untrained as an architect, Rocky played an unusually active role in the design of the South Mall. His (literally) back-of-the envelope concept sketch, inspired by Potala Palace high above Lhasa, Tibet, would become the basis of the massive modernist office and cultural complex most commonly compared to the Brazilian capital of Brasilia. Indeed, the governor&rsquo;s aesthetic stamp marked the very foundation of the South Mall, the half-mile long, quarter-mile wide platform connecting the Capitol to the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion. This &ldquo;great wall,&rdquo; according to lead architect Wallace K. Harrison, was intended to &ldquo;separate the Mall into a kind of community.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>On April 23, 1963, nine months after demolition began, the State&rsquo;s South Mall plan was finally unveiled at a press event in the Capitol Rotunda. Reviews in the local newspapers were uniformly positive&mdash;not surprising since the newspapers&rsquo; publisher was a member of the Temporary State Commission on the Capital City. &ldquo;Impressive, dramatic, marvelous, terrific, pleasing, magnificent and thrilling&rdquo; were the comments recorded by one Times Union reporter. Mayor Corning enthused, &ldquo;As I look at this magnificent model, I consider it the most significant day in the entire history of Albany and of the State&hellip;. I will do everything in my power to see that it becomes a reality as quickly and in as fine a fashion as is humanly possible.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>These 1963 architectural renderings by Marcel Mutin helped promote the South Mall, particularly when juxtaposed to State photographs of the most rundown sections of the area to be demolished.</p>

			<p>Outside of Albany, reviews of the $250 million (estimated) capitol complex were considerably less kind. Mostly famously, an unsigned critique in the influential journal Progressive Architecture dismissed the South Mall design as &ldquo;an exercise in architectural pop art.&rdquo; The reviewer blamed the governor and his enablers for its faults. Despite pushback from Rockefeller supporters, the journal&rsquo;s editor stood by the critique, especially criticism of the governor&rsquo;s role in the design process. &ldquo;Quite a few architects are disturbed by this approach to planning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Albany deserves the best, and I don&rsquo;t think it is getting the best.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Despite criticism, the South Mall project moved inexorably forward.  By the end of 1963, the State had displaced the majority of area residents, and demolition was more than halfway complete.</p>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>Demolition created a citywide shortage of cheap apartments and furnished rooms. Complicating matters was an informal but well-enforced system of residential segregation, which prevented African Americans from moving into most sections of the city. (It was not until 1968 that the Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination in housing sales and rentals.) Combined with segregation, displacement meant increased racial concentration as well as overcrowding in those areas of the city that welcomed black homeowners and tenants.</p>

			<p>In the fall of 1963, Times Union reporter Dick Weber described how racial discrimination affected rehousing of displaced black families: &ldquo;The South Mall Relocation Office has helped find new places for several hundred South Mall residents, white and Negro. When a landlord says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t send any Negroes,&rsquo; the Mall office crosses the property off the list of available apartments. It has had to cross off quite a few properties.&rdquo;</p>

			</div>

			<p>Weber featured the story of Arthur and Yvonne Mitchell, middle-class homeowners with plenty of money for a down payment. Because of their race, the Mitchells struggled to find a new home in the majority-white neighborhoods of west Albany. Arthur allowed the reporter to listen in on a call with his realtor:
				<ul>
					<li>Realtor: &ldquo;I talked to that woman again about the house on Glendale Avenue. She said she just won&rsquo;t sell to a Negro&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
					<li>Arthur: &ldquo;What can we do then?&rdquo;</li>
					<li>Realtor: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I guess that&rsquo;s all there is to it. There just isn&rsquo;t anything I can do. If she won&rsquo;t sell, she won&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>As their white neighbors moved out, the Mitchells were stuck in place. Over the course of time, they found themselves surrounded by empty houses on which, Weber wrote, &ldquo;vandals have put the seal of vacancy—smashed windows.&rdquo;</p>

			</div>

			<p>Arthur and Yvonne Mitchell weathered over a year of insults and refusals before they found a new home on Victor Street. They were one of a group of roughly 82 middle-income black families living outside of Albany&rsquo;s increasingly crowded and dilapidated ghettoes. Black families with fewer economic and social resources were barred from most areas of the city. Taking advantage of their plight, unscrupulous landlords rented displaced families overpriced and substandard housing units.</p>

			<p>Rooming house owners, a largely white group of mostly single, divorced, or widowed women, faced different hardships. Because the assessed value of South Mall properties was lower than the cost of similar structures in other parts of the city, many of these women struggled to make ends meet. Starting over in her early 60s, Ada Skinner, for example, was able to afford only one house for the amount she received for two in the South Mall area. In addition to economic stress, she suffered from the loss of community. Before the South Mall, her siblings and closest friends were also her neighbors.</p>

			<p>Displacement was hardest on elderly residents, like Fred Binseel, a retired Capitol security guard, who lived alone on a limited income. In December 1963, when he moved out of his longtime home, Fred was 83 years old and recently widowed. He didn&rsquo;t want to leave, but his S. Hawk Street apartment building was already under contract for demolition. Assistance and pressure from a State relocation officer finally got him to move. Nine months later, Fred showed up at the offices of the Temporary State Commission on the Capital City, desperate, fearful, and complaining of ill health. His apartment smelled of gas, and he didn&rsquo;t trust the water. He suspected his new neighbors and landlord of stealing from him. The extent to which these accusations derived from his actual living conditions versus emotional distress is unclear.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard for us to pull up roots. We had a lovely life here,&rdquo; Emma Leonard told Dick Weber on December 22, 1964, the day she and her family became the last to move out of the South Mall redevelopment area. By that time, the Leonard family home overlooking Lincoln Park was surrounded by the rubble-strewn remnants of the Italian-Irish Catholic community into which Emma had been born, grown up, married, and become a mother. She described witnessing its destruction over the past two-and-a-half years as a &ldquo;nightmare.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Although the South Mall area had been emptied of all residents and most buildings by the end of 1964, the City and State were still wrangling over the terms of a financing agreement to underwrite construction. As city and state officials traded accusations, locals greeted the delay with frustration and dark humor.</p>

			<p>Times Union columnist John Maguire captured this sentiment: &ldquo;The way things have been going lately around Albany, it begins to look as if the South Mall may never be finished or at best may be delayed a long time. I think we ought to start thinking about what to do with all that open space. Someone here in the office said it looks like good soil for planting celery, but 98 acres set to celery seems a bit much. Someone else said it&rsquo;s terraced so it would make good rice paddies, and another man said why not let Ag-and-Markets use it for an experiment farm where they could grow okra and raise alpaca&hellip;. Another original thinker said it would make a good arena for teenage rumbles, because there&rsquo;s a lot of bricks handy &hellip; and no windows to break. There were two votes for a new municipal golf course, two for a ski slope and one for flooding it and having ice skating.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>For the next several months, Albany residents lived with this uncertainty. Would the State rebuild? Or would the South Mall remain a massive hole in the heart of the city?</p>
